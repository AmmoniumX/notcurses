The Erisian Code of Conduct, version 1.0


* Hail Eris! All hail Discordia!
* Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
* Snitches get stitches.
* If someone is bothering you, a good thing to do is rewrite their
   contributions in a way that incontrovertibly improves them. They'll
   often get frustrated, and leave.
* What the eye sees and the mind covets, let the hand boldly seize.
* Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et
  cum illi pueri dicerent: Σίβνλλα τί ϴέλεις; respondebat illa: άπο ϴανεΐν ϴέλω.
* Code talks, bullshit walks.
