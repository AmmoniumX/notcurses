             **An Erisian Code of Conduct, version 1.1**

* Hail Eris. All hail Discordia.
* Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
* Snitches get stitches.
* If someone is bothering you, a good thing to do might be rewriting their
   contributions in a way that leaves the code incontrovertibly improved.
   The best revenge is getting good hacks on.
* What the eye sees and the mind covets, let the hand boldly seize!
* Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et
  cum illi pueri dicerent: Σίβνλλα τί ϴέλεις; respondebat illa: άπο ϴανεΐν ϴέλω.
* Code talks, bullshit walks.
