# A Code of Conduct

## KEEP IT DANK

* Hail Eris. All hail Discordia.
* Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
* Snitches get stitches.
* If someone is bothering you, a good thing to do might be rewriting their contributions in a way that leaves the code incontrovertibly improved. The best revenge is getting good hacks on.
* What the eye sees and the mind covets, let the hand boldly seize!
* Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent: *Σίβνλλα τί ϴέλεις*; respondebat illa: *άπο ϴανεΐν ϴέλω*.
